syntax: ./master -f <testfilename>

arguments:
-f <testfilename> will read in a file with palindromes, one per line and evaluate

Source with revision control is at https://github.com/chrisbartz/cs4760-p2

The project has most requirements working or at least attempted:

Parent:
master accepts a file via console arguments: working
master reads a file with palindromes: working
master creates shared memory: working 
master writes to shared memory: kind of working - can write but overwrites the previous writes
master forks children: working
master regulates child process count: working
master "waits" for child processes to terminate before returning: working
master detatches and destroys shared memory after children are terminated: working
master handles ^C interrupt command: working

Children:
master (children) exec palin: working
master (children) exec relative path: working
palin (children) receives id from console command passed from parent: working
palin connects to shared memory: working
palin reads shared memory: kind of working - they can read the shared memory segment but the data gets overwritten on write
palin outputs to file: working
palin solves palindrome: working
palin randomly waits before entering critical section: working
palin handles critical section: not working
palin detaches from shared memory when done: working

Others:
project is available in Github
makefile implemented
README implemented
testfile has 55 inputs

There is only one example command that works for this project

./master -f testfile
