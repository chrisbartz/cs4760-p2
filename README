###### NEED TO UPDATE FOR PROJECT 2 BELOW ######

syntax: ./my_prog <arguments>

arguments:
-h prints help
-n # sets the number of processes to fork
-k # number of times to print the same information
-m # controls the delay in printing in seconds
-w sets wait for child process
-c # will read # chars input from each process and change the output (question 8)

Source with revision control is at https://github.com/chrisbartz/cs4760-p2

The project was done sequentially - all changes from question 1 should carry over to question 2 etc...
The book doesnt really say to start over with 3.1 for each question so that is how I did the exercises.
I will extract each program from version control and name it main1.c for question1, main2.c for question 2, etc...
Likewise executables my_prog1 is for question 1, my_prog2 is for question 2...
my_prog and my_prog8 should be exactly the same since I didnt change the final source and kept my numbering scheme.

I will give some example commands that should work when everything is built:

1. 	./my_prog1 25
	./my_prog1 2500
2. 	./my_prog2 25
3. 	./my_prog3 100000 &> output3
4. 	./my_prog3 200 &> output4
5. 	./my_prog5 -n 25 -k 2 -m 1
6. 	./my_prog6 -n 25 -k 2 -m 0
	./my_prog -n 25 -k 1 -m 0 -w
7. 	./my_prog7 -n 25 -k 1 -m 0
8.	./my_prog8 -n 25 -k 1 -m 0 -c 2
